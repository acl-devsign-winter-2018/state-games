Objective
===

Create a state-based adventure game with react. Create rooms to explore with items and challenges.
  - This game should have at least four rooms or scenes that the player can move between.
  - Tracks players items
  - Have items that the player can interact and at least one monster or character the player defeats or interacts with.
  - Provide ways for user to specify what they want to do (button, input, etc)

Steps Taken
===

Create rooms with descriptions, items, pokemon, and use methods for items in particular rooms. Create a Room component that takes this data and creates an interactive room. Add a Trainer component that keeps track of items the user has collected and the users name. Create a puzzle where some items are required to obtain others and move forward in the game.

Reflection / Changes
===

The was a fun way to better understand state. I had to think creatively about how items would interact with one another, and where that interactivity would live (rooms.js vs the item itself). I wish I had more time to build more fun ideas into it and make it look nice!
